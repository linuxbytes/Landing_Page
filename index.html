            GNU Bash or simply Bash is a Unix shell and command language written
            by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for
            the Bourne shell. Bash is a command processor that typically runs in
            a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash
            can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell
            script.Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful
            features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).

            The Bash command syntax is a superset of the Bourne shell command
            syntax. Bash supports brace expansion, command line completion
            (Programmable Completion)[35], basic debugging[36] and signal
            handling (using trap) since bash 2.05a[37] among other features.
            Bash can execute the vast majority of Bourne shell scripts without
            modification, with the exception of Bourne shell scripts stumbling
            into fringe syntax behavior interpreted differently in Bash or
            attempting to run a system command matching a newer Bash builtin,
            etc. Bash command syntax includes ideas drawn from the Korn shell
            (ksh) and the C shell (csh) such as command line editing, command
            history (history command)[38], the directory stack, the $RANDOM and
            $PPID variables, and POSIX command substitution syntax $(â€¦).
