              GNU Bash or simply Bash is a Unix shell and command language
              written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software
              replacement for the Bourne shell. Bash is a command processor that
              typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that
              cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a
              file, called a shell script.Bash is an sh-compatible shell that
              incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell
              (csh).
            </p>

              Brian Fox began coding Bash on January 10, 1988 after Richard
              Stallman became dissatisfied with the lack of progress being made
              by a prior developer. Stallman and the Free Software Foundation
              (FSF) considered a free shell that could run existing shell
              scripts so strategic to a completely free system built from BSD
              and GNU code that this was one of the few projects they funded
              themselves, with Fox undertaking the work as an employee of FSF.
              Fox released Bash as a beta, version .99, on June 8, 1989 and
              remained the primary maintainer until sometime between mid-1992
              and mid-1994, when he was laid off from FSF and his responsibility
              was transitioned to another early contributor, Chet Ramey

          <p>
            Navigating the Bash shell is easy to do. But it takes time to learn
            how to do well. Below are a number of shortcuts that make the
            navigation process much more efficient.

            <p>$ echo a{p,c,d,b}e</p>
            <p>ape ace ade abe</p>
            <p>$ echo {a,b,c}{d,e,f}</p>
