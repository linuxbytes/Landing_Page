          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            GNU Bash or simply Bash is a Unix shell and command language written
            by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for
            the Bourne shell. Bash is a command processor that typically runs in
            a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash
            can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell
            script.Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful
            features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).
          </p>
          <p>
            Brian Fox began coding Bash on January 10, 1988 after Richard
            Stallman became dissatisfied with the lack of progress being made by
            a prior developer. Stallman and the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
            considered a free shell that could run existing shell scripts so
            strategic to a completely free system built from BSD and GNU code
            that this was one of the few projects they funded themselves, with
            Fox undertaking the work as an employee of FSF. Fox released Bash as
            a beta, version .99, on June 8, 1989 and remained the primary
            maintainer until sometime between mid-1992 and mid-1994, when he was
            laid off from FSF and his responsibility was transitioned to another
            early contributor, Chet Ramey

          <h2>Features</h2>
          <p>
            Navigating the Bash shell is easy to do. But it takes time to learn
            how to do well. Below are a number of shortcuts that make the
            navigation process much more efficient. to name a few below
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ctrl+C: Interrupt (kill) the current foreground process running in
              in the terminal.
            </li>
            <li>Ctrl+S: Stop all output to the screen.</li>
            <li>Ctrl+A or Home: Go to the beginning of the line.</li>
            <li>Ctrl+E or End: Go to the end of the line.</li>
            <li>Ctrl+D or Delete: Delete the character under the cursor.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The improvements offered by Bash include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Command line editing</li>
            <li>Unlimited size command history</li>
            <li>Job Control</li>
            <li>Shell Functions and Aliases</li>
            <li>Indexed arrays of unlimited size</li>
            <li>Integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Bash command syntax is a superset of the Bourne shell command
            syntax. Bash supports brace expansion, command line completion
            (Programmable Completion), basic debugging and signal handling
            (using trap) since bash 2.05a among other features. Bash can execute
            the vast majority of Bourne shell scripts without modification, with
            the exception of Bourne shell scripts stumbling into fringe syntax
            behavior interpreted differently in Bash or attempting to run a
            system command matching a newer Bash builtin, etc. Bash command
            syntax includes ideas drawn from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C
            shell (csh) such as command line editing, command history (history
            command), the directory stack, the $RANDOM and $PPID variables, and
            POSIX command substitution syntax $(…).

          <h2>Documentation</h2>
          <p>
            Documentation for Bash is available online
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/">link</a>
            , as is documentation for most GNU software. You may also find more
            information about Bash by running info bash or man bash, or by
            looking at /usr/doc/bash/, /usr/local/doc/bash/, or similar
            directories on your system. A brief summary is available by running
            bash --help.
